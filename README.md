# Lab4Embedded

This lab aimed to test the functionality of the PWM outputs on the MSP430FR2355. Problem_1.c requires a jumper cable to be attacched from P6.0 to the green LED while Problem_2.c and Problem_3.c requires a cable from P1.6 instead. Problem_1.c toggles the LED every 250ms. Problem_2.c and Problem_3.c output a steady PWM signal to the green LED with a duty cycle of 10% and 20% respectively.
